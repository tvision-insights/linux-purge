.SH DESCRIPTION
Purge versioned kernel packages according to user's orders. Purging is
not restricted to linux\-image packages, but all versioned linux\-*
packages matching desired releases. Also purges such versioned
kernel packages that have the respective linux\-image package missing
or marked for removal or purge, and packages that have just
configuration files remaining. Does not purge such versioned kernel
packages that have respective successfully installed linux\-image
package marked with "hold" unless chosen interactively with \fB\-\-choose\fR
option.
.PP
If usual purging fails, using \fB\-\-fix\fR option may help.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-auto\-only\fR
Only purge kernels that have been marked as being
automatically installed.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-clear\-boot\fR
Check \fI\,/boot\/\fP for kernels unknown to the package
management system, and if such files are found,
offer to remove them.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-choose\fR
Choose interactively which kernels to purge. Other
options determine which kernels are selected to
start with.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR[=\fI\,FILE\/\fR]
Write the command trace and some other debug
information in the given FILE. If FILE is not
given, a file in a tmpfs is created and the name
is shown in stderr finally.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fix\fR
Use this, if the program fails otherwise. Try to
fix broken dependencies, which are typical in case
a filesystem has no space left. If needed, try to
purge given kernel(s) interactively by using
different methods to be able to purge kernels from
a system with broken dependencies and/or lack of
free inodes.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-info\fR
Show some kernel related information using pager.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fI\,APP\/\fR
Use application APP for generating user interface
when selecting kernels with option \fB\-\-choose\fR and
\fB\-\-fix\fR. Supported values for APP:
.IP
d or dialog (default)
.IP
w or whiptail (fallback)
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
Keep NUM latest kernels that have earlier version
and same flavour than each kernel a meta\-kernel
(such as linux\-image\-generic) depends on.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
Only output the packages that would be purged (or
removed, if \fB\-r\fR was used). The list may not be
complete, as there may be some packages depending
on those.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-manual\fR
Purge kernels that have been marked as being
manually installed.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-legend\fR
Do not display legend in checklist with options
\fB\-\-choose\fR and \fB\-\-fix\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-optimize\fR
Run update\-grub only once in normal operation.
IMPORTANT: If linux\-purge gets killed when this
option is used, updage\-grub may be left
non\-executable! In that case you can run
linux\-purge again to enable update\-grub.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
Remove packages instead of purging them.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simulate\fR
Dry\-run; do not actually remove packages. You may
run this as regular user. Note that in some cases
simulation is not complete since some actions may
depend on others being done for real beforehand.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Purge without user confirmation.
