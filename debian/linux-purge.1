.SH NAME
Linux \- manual page for Linux Purge for Ubuntu 1.0
.SH DESCRIPTION
Usage (using short options):
.PP
linux\-purge [\-bcnosy] [{\-k NUM [\-a]} | \fB\-m]\fR [\-i APP]
.PP
linux\-purge \fB\-f\fR [\-sn] [\-i APP]
.PP
linux\-purge {\-h | \fB\-v\fR}
.PP
Purge versioned kernel packages according to user's orders. Purging is
not restricted to linux\-image packages, but all versioned linux\-*
packages matching desired releases. Also purges such versioned
kernel packages that have the respective linux\-image package missing
or marked for removal or purge, and packages that have just
configuration files remaining. Does not purge such versioned kernel
packages that have respective successfully installed linux\-image
package marked with "hold" unless chosen interactively with \fB\-c\fR option.
.PP
If usual purging fails, using \fB\-f\fR option may help.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-auto\-only\fR Only purge kernels that have been marked as being
automatically installed.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-clear\-boot\fR
Check \fI\,/boot\/\fP for kernels unknown to the package
management system, and if such files are found,
offer to remove them.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-choose\fR
Choose interactively which kernels to purge. Other
options determine which kernels are selected to
start with.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fix\fR
Use this, if the program fails otherwise. Try to fix
broken dependencies, which are typical in case a
filesystem has no space left. If needed, try to purge
given kernel(s) interactively by using different
methods to be able to purge kernels from a system
with broken dependencies and/or lack of free inodes.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR APP, \fB\-iAPP\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR APP, \fB\-\-interface\fR=\fI\,APP\/\fR
Choose application used for generating user interface, when
selecting kernels; see option \fB\-c\fR.
.IP
Supported values for APP:
.IP
d or dialog (default)
.IP
w or whiptail (fallback)
.TP
\fB\-k\fR NUM, \fB\-kNUM\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR NUM, \fB\-\-keep\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
Keep NUM latest kernels that have earlier version
and same flavour than each kernel a meta\-kernel
(such as linux\-image\-generic) depends on.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-manual\fR
Purge kernels that have been marked as being
manually installed.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-legend\fR Do not display legend in checklist used by \fB\-c\fR and \fB\-f\fR.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-optimize\fR
Run update\-grub only once in normal operation.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simulate\fR
Dry\-run; do not actually remove packages. You may
run this as regular user. Note that in some cases
simulation is not complete since some actions may
depend on others being done for real beforehand.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version.
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-yes\fR
Purge without user confirmation.
